## Project Instructions

### A. Data Selection and Preparation  
1. **Choose a Data Set**  
   - Select a data set of a quantity with **daily values over two years** that is publicly available.  
   - Examples: Covid-19 cases, stock market data, oil/gas prices, meteorological data, etc.  
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Ensure the data set is free of inconsistencies, outliers, and missing values.  

---

### B. Forecasting Using the First Year of Data  
Using the **1st year of cleaned data**, forecast data for **months 2–12** based on the data from the **1st month**.  

1. **Forecasting Techniques**  
   - Use **three different forecasting techniques** for forecasting the level (without trend or seasonality adjustments).  
   - If a technique is parametric, determine the **optimal parameter values**.  
2. **Comparison of Techniques**  
   - Compare the three techniques using **two different methods**.  
3. **Trend-Adjusted Forecasting**  
   - Identify any trends in the data, estimate them, and incorporate **trend adjustments** into your forecast.  
4. **Seasonality Adjustment**  
   - Identify seasonality factors, estimate them, and apply **seasonality adjustments** to your forecast.

### C. Forecasting Using the Second Year of Data  
Repeat the steps in Section **B** using the **2nd year of cleaned data**:  

1. **Re-optimize Parameters**  
   - Ensure that any parametric values are re-optimized for the 2nd year’s data set.  

---

### D. Comparison of Data Sets  
- Compare the **1st year and 2nd year** data sets based on:  
  1. The forecasts you made.  
  2. The actual data available.  
- Provide a **quantitative description** of how the two data sets differ.  

---

### E. Monthly Data Set Analysis  
1. **Select a Monthly Data Set**  
   - Choose a data set containing **12 data points** from either the 1st or 2nd year of data.  
   - Example: Data collected on the **1st day of each month**.  
2. **Find Similar Data Sets**  
   - Identify at least **10 additional data sets** with similar characteristics (e.g., weather data from 10 other municipalities).  
3. **Run Forecasting**  
   - Apply your **best forecasting technique** to the 12-point data set.  
   - Adjust the forecast using insights from the other 10 similar data sets.

### Final Report  
- Submit a detailed report (**~3000 words**) including:  
  - Methodology.  
  - Code.  
  - Plots.  
  - Presentation.
